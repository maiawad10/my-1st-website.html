  <h1>How it all started</h1> 
  <hr/>
  <p>I remember when i first put my hand on the first car magazine. they used to come with the news papers every month &
     the annual one come at the end of the year</p>
  <p> once i get the magazine i get lost in it, imagining myself to drive each car and which one would suit me the most <br/>
      learning about how good the car is didn't facinate me as much as how good the car look, it can be a very bad car when it comes to quality but its shape
    is just a *chef kiss* like the Jeep Wrangler for example </p> 
  <p>But one thing i can put my mind into it is the old classic cars are my favourite, but sadly they won't be able to perform good for an everyday use.<br/>
     That's why i am willing to collect some of my fav once i earn enough money. but for now let's talk a look at my 1st car that i fall in love with & also my 
     my current car collection i am willing to choose from the day i am ready to buy my first car ever </p>

  <h2>The first car i fel in love with</h2>
  <hr/>
  <br/>
  <p>THE FIRST 3-DOOR CAR IN THE WORLD. This was the title that took my attention and a photo of an orange hatchback car with its 3 doors open
     glowing in the bottom of the page <br/>
     Hyundai volester,this was its name, hunted my mind for next few days until i saw it with the exact color in the town street that's when i said to myself 
     -11 year old me- this going to be my future car.<br/>
     Although as i explore more i became more interested in other models, this car still hold a place in my heart.
